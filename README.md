## Abstract

The tourism in Jordan  has increased significantly. When tourists come to Jordan they are overwhelmed by the number of touristic places they can go, this makes deciding theyâ€™re trip difficult and time consuming.
Our App will help the tourist decide where to go according to their conditions and provide them with information about the trip they want to go.
The app is expected to improve the tourist experience when touring in Jordan through providing several facilities.

write scenario, imagine to how will be implemented, [Implementation First Scenario.](./Scenarios/first-scenario.md).

Sketch an prototyping using pen and paper:

- Tourist Prototyping:  
    - ![' '](./assets/wireframe-prototyping-tourist.jpeg).

<summary> Second Day - Friday (10/6/2022)</summary>

- In today we start from writing some logic like:

    - Login And validation using FirebaseAuth and FirebaseUser and FirebaseDatabase.
    - Register Using Firebase.
    - 

- Using firebase our "users"  Database  will have the attributes:
    - username
    - age
    - sex 
    - nationality
    - email
    - password
    - role "tourist", "admin", "agent"

- In Scenario, we said if login successful the next activity depends on roles:
    - if role was "tourist", will go to TouristHomePage.
    - else if was "admin",will go to AdminHomePage
    - else if was "agent", will go to AgentHomePage

so, lets crreate the screens first:

- Create an 3 Activties at first: 
    - Admin Home Activity:
        * !["AdminHome"](./assets/adminHomePage.PNG).
    - Agent Home Activity:
        * !["AgentHome"](./assets/agentHomePage.PNG).
    - Tourist Home Activity:
        * !["Tourist Home"](./assets/touristHomePage.PNG)

<summary> Third Day - Saturday (11/6/2022)</summary>

- Yesterday we create a basic three activities :
    1. Admin Home Page
    2. Agent Home Page
    3. Tourist Home Page
So, Let's start with the logic of it. All our implementation will be depend on senario, we have a part 2 of the scenario [please see it](./Scenarios/first-scenario.md). 

- After implement some functionality of the screens like navigate, we create a class called `Plan` that have an attribute of the plan, and to make save and edit more easier.

- The plans need to save it in list, and to show the list we need to define an recyclerView. So we use `Firestore.RecyclerView`, thats will help to save the plan object or item to firebase database.

- When we want to use list and recycler view we need to use something called `adapter`, so we create `PlanAdapter` and `PlanRecyclyerView`.

- The add plan page that using by agent to add a new plan, i need the information about the plan and then save it into `firebase.firestore`, so we design the `add plan screen` as below:
    - !["Add Plan Screen"](./assets/addPlanPage.PNG).

- Each plan will have some attributes and some values, how we will show :
    - we using an `CardView`, this Card View will contain the info about plan.
    - !["CarView"](./assets/planDetails.PNG).

- We talk about the `RecyclerView`, and `FirestoreRecyclerView`, we design an activity that contains an `FirestoreRecyclerView`, that contain an items of type `CardView`, using the adapter will control the view and using ciewModel will be easier, see design below:
    - !["FirestoreRecyclerView"](./assets/planRecyclerView.PNG)

    - tripImage: byte[]
    - tripType: String

- Define Setters and Getters for each class.
- In `AddTripActiviy`, add a `DatePicker` for each of (`startDate`, `EndDate`), and add  a `description` field, also the add `ImageView`, when click on it will make user able to upload a image, then it will upload to the `firebaseDatabase`, when click on `addTrip` button will validate all the filed are required.

          ```
    - Then the data will be saved as below:
        ```json
        
        "Users":{
            "tourist":{
                    "Id":{
