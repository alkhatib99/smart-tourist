Then change directory into the repo

```Shell

```

Create an project inside the directory using android studio.

write scenario, imagine to how will be implemented, [Implementation First Scenario.](./Scenarios/first-scenario.md).

Sketch an prototyping using pen and paper:

- Tourist Prototyping:  
    - ![' '](./assets/wireframe-prototyping-tourist.jpeg).

- Admin & Agent Prototyping:
    - ![' '](./assets/wireframe-prototyping-agent-and-admin.jpeg).
 
 <br>

Start design the user interface and their logc depend on scenario .

<summary> Second Day - Friday (10/6/2022)</summary>

- In today we start from writing some logic like:

    - Login And validation using FirebaseAuth and FirebaseUser and FirebaseDatabase.
    - Register Using Firebase.
    - 

- Using firebase our "users"  Database  will have the attributes:
    - username
    - age
    - sex 
    - nationality
    - email
    - password
    - role "tourist", "admin", "agent"

- In Scenario, we said if login successful the next activity depends on roles:
    - if role was "tourist", will go to TouristHomePage.
    - else if was "admin",will go to AdminHomePage
    - else if was "agent", will go to AgentHomePage

so, lets crreate the screens first:

- Create an 3 Activties at first: 
    - Admin Home Activity:
        * !["AdminHome"](./assets/adminHomePage.PNG).
    - Agent Home Activity:
        * !["AgentHome"](./assets/agentHomePage.PNG).
    - Tourist Home Activity:
        * !["Tourist Home"](./assets/touristHomePage.PNG)
</details>

<summary> Third Day - Saturday (11/6/2022)</summary>

- Yesterday we create a basic three activities :
    1. Admin Home Page
    2. Agent Home Page
    3. Tourist Home Page
So, Let's start with the logic of it. All our implementation will be depend on senario, we have a part 2 of the scenario [please see it](./Scenarios/first-scenario.md). 

- After implement some functionality of the screens like navigate, we create a class called `Plan` that have an attribute of the plan, and to make save and edit more easier.

- The plans need to save it in list, and to show the list we need to define an recyclerView. So we use `Firestore.RecyclerView`, thats will help to save the plan object or item to firebase database.

- When we want to use list and recycler view we need to use something called `adapter`, so we create `PlanAdapter` and `PlanRecyclyerView`.

- The add plan page that using by agent to add a new plan, i need the information about the plan and then save it into `firebase.firestore`, so we design the `add plan screen` as below:
    - !["Add Plan Screen"](./assets/addPlanPage.PNG).

- Each plan will have some attributes and some values, how we will show :
    - we using an `CardView`, this Card View will contain the info about plan.
    - !["CarView"](./assets/planDetails.PNG).

- We talk about the `RecyclerView`, and `FirestoreRecyclerView`, we design an activity that contains an `FirestoreRecyclerView`, that contain an items of type `CardView`, using the adapter will control the view and using ciewModel will be easier, see design below:
    - !["FirestoreRecyclerView"](./assets/planRecyclerView.PNG)
